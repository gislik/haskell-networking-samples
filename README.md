==========================

Haskell networking code samples used in my Haskell - network programming and tinkering presentation

The Haskell code provided is written in a very simple manner, i.e. no monads, functors, etc. This should make things a bit easier for new-comers to the languages.

Latest version of the slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1z4VAnZgRRShlvgVgL1WM3fnPLuBODS0uU9ICQ2a1V1c/edit).
